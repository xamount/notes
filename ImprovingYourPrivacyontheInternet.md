# Improving Your Privacy on the Internet - Doable Steps For Non-Technical People

## Protecting your privacy from Google.

While signed into your Google/Gmail account search for "Google Privacy Checkup"

Set the following settings to "Paused"
Web & App Activity
Location History

These 2 are the most important settings in my opinion. But also pause:

Voice & Audio Activity
YouTube Search History
YouTube Watch History


Signing into Chrome.
You may want to be signed into Google. It's convenient to have Gmail open in one tab, and say Google Docs open in another.
But signing into the Chrome browser itself? Probably not a good idea unless you really have a use and understanding of what it does.

+ Recommendation: use Chrome for Google services like Gmail/Photos/Google Docs. Use Firefox for everything else.



## Install an ad-blocker

My top 3 choices
- uBlock Origin
- DuckDuckGo Privacy
- Ghostery

## Browser Choices

On a PC: Best for privacy is Firefox, especially with the Multi-Account container tabs extension. Look it up.

On Android: use Firefox as your browser. Put it on the home screen so you are not tempted to use Chrome. Install the uBlock Origin ad blocker extension.

## Email

### Outlook.com/Hotmail.com
Inbox aliases: Outlook.com/Hotmail.com
You can make an alias email for your email. i.e If your email is joeblow@outlook.com  you can make a few aliases for specific purposes.
i.e  myshopping123@outlook.com , mysocialnetworks123@outlook.com.  Then make subfolders for each of the aliases and create inbox rules
to deliver emails sent to those alias emails to those subfolders.

More advanced:
Use + labels when you signup for services. Not all sites recognize them as valid parts of an email address but most do.

So you have mysocialnetworks123@outlook.com as an email alias
Now signup for Facebook with mysocialnetworks123+facebook@outlook.com
Signup for Twitter with mysocialnetworks123+twitter@outlook.com
Signup for Pinterest with mysocialnetworks123+pinterest@outlook.com

Sign up for eBay with myshopping123+ebay@outlook.com
Sign up for Ali Express with myshopping123+aliexpress@outlook.com

+ labels don't do anything but are useful for keeping things separate. And you can create Inbox rules based on them.

### GMail
GMail supports + labels BUT doesn't support aliases that are completely different the way Outlook.com does.

So if you have joeblow@gmail.com, you can't create myshopping123@gmail.com from within the same account.
You can however use a joeblow+twitter@gmail.com for example

One alternative is to make another Gmail account with myshopping123@gmail.com
From within joeblow@gmail.com you can set myshopping123@gmail.com as an email you own, and one that you can send email "As".
Then set it to forward to joeblow+myshopping123@gmail.com.


### Passwords
The best way is to use a password manager like Last Pass that produces randomized passwords.

But if you can't be bothered at least use a pass *phrase* like - Mypuppylikesbeef32.
Now "salt" it with the service name. ie.  Myfacebookpuppylikesbeef32 or Myebaypuppylikesbeef32

There are some passwords that are important - i.e ones your loved ones might need to pass onto the police in case you are murdered i.e
email and social networks, phone pin.
Write them down on paper - and put that paper in a safety deposit box.
If you don't have a formal will, write one by hand (these are accepted by courts) wherein you appoint an executor who will be able
to access that safety deposit box.

Commit to updating all your passwords every 2 years.

## Smartphone

Don't install free applications by unknown companies. There is a good chance they are scooping your data. Flashlight apps are notorious for this.

# Technical Steps

Switch the DNS in your router to Cloudflare's service. Don't make it easy for ISP to track you.
Install the Https Everywhere extension in your browser.
